/*
 * io.h — x86 port-mapped I/O primitives
 *
 * The x86 architecture has two separate address spaces:
 *   1. Memory space  — accessed with normal load/store instructions.
 *   2. I/O port space — a 64 KB address space (ports 0x0000–0xFFFF)
 *      accessed with the special IN and OUT instructions.
 *
 * Most legacy PC hardware (keyboard controller, timer, RTC, VGA
 * cursor, PC speaker …) lives in I/O port space rather than in
 * regular memory. These three inline functions are the only
 * abstraction you need to talk to all of that hardware.
 *
 * NOTE: This header is NOT included on Raspberry Pi (PLATFORM_RPI3).
 * ARM uses memory-mapped I/O exclusively — all peripherals are
 * reached via normal pointer dereferences to physical addresses.
